            "@value": "The Festivus is a publication about malacology and conchology published by the San Diego Shell Club in San Diego, California. The Festivus started in 1970 as a shell club newsletter edited by Blanche Brewer. In 1976 Carole Hertz became the editor, and gradually The Festivus became more scientifically respectable, and was transformed into a peer-reviewed scientific journal. From 1985 up until 2014, issues of The Festivus contained scientific papers on mollusks, and each paper was peer-reviewed by a professional malacologist. Eleven issues were published annually: one issue per month, except for the month of December. Carole Hertz was editor for 37 years."
